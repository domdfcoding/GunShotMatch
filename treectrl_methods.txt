Not all of the methods from wx.TreeCtrl are implemented in wx.lib.agw.hypertreectrl.HyperTreeCtrl and wx.lib.agw.customtreectrl.CustomTreeCtrl. I've made a list of the missing methods.

Some of them are easy to implement in HyperTreeCtrl, since they have already been implemented in CustomTreeCtrl. These methods are:

	SetItemData
	GetItemData
	IsVisible

These can be implemented in HyperTreeCtrl by adding them to the `_method` list in hypertreectrl.py.

The rest need to be implemented in CustomTreeCtrl first. These are:

	CollapseAll
	CollapseAllChildren

	GetItemState
	SetItemState

	ClearFocusedItem
	GetFocusedItem
	SetFocusedItem

	EnableBellOnNoMatch
	EndEditLabel
	IsEmpty
	SelectChildren
	UnselectItem

I've made a start by implementing CollapseAll and CollapseAllChildren, based on the existing ExpandAll and ExpandAllChildren methods, and these seem to work as expected.
